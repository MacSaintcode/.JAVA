### Submission Mode : After every task, create and push tasks to that branch, Make a Pull Request (PR) to main
### Never make direct commits to branch 'main'
### Pull from branch main before starting a new task and before making a PR
### Other than task 1, do not commence another task except that the previous task has been accepted, merged means accepted
#### Branch name format: task_{taskNumber}_{yourFirstName}, e.g task_4_olawale

## Task 1:
- [ ] Clone Repo
- [ ] Submit

## Problem Statement
You have been assigned to develop a code for Course Enrollment and Grade Management System in Java for a university. 
The code should provide functionality to enroll students in courses, assign grades to students, and calculate overall course grades for each student. 
The code should demonstrate the effective utilization of static methods and variables to keep track of enrollment and grade-related information across multiple instances of the Student and Course classes. 
It should also showcase your ability to manipulate object state and define behavior through instance methods.


## Requirements
- [ ] Student Class
- [ ] Course Class
- [ ] CourseManagement  Class

## Task 2:
- [X] Clone Repo
- [ ] Create src directory 
- [ ] Create the classes, empty classes, no implementations
- [ ] Submit


### Student Class

- [ ] The Student class should have private instance variables to store student information such as name, ID, and enrolled courses.
- [ ] Implement appropriate access modifiers and provide public getter and setter methods for accessing and updating student information.
- [ ] Design a method to enroll students in courses. It should accept a Course object as a parameter and add the course to the student's enrolled courses.
- [ ] Implement a method to assign grades to students. It should accept a Course object and a grade for the student and update the student's grade for that course. 

## Task 3:
- [X] Clone Repo
- [X] Create src directory 
- [X] Create the classes, empty classes, no implementations
- [ ] Implement Student Class
- [ ] Submit


### Course Class

- [ ] The Course class should have private instance variables to store course information such as course code, name, and maximum capacity.
- [ ] Use appropriate access modifiers and provide public getter methods for accessing course information.
- [ ] Implement a static variable to keep track of the total number of enrolled students across all instances of the Course class.
- [ ] Design a static method to retrieve the total number of enrolled students.
